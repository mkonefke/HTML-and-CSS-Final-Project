	<h3>How does someone become inspiring or get inspired?
	</h3>
	<p>There are many different definitions of inspiration.&nbsp; The Collins 
	English Dictionary has several definitions that align with how I view 
	inspiration:<p><cite>"Inspiration is a feeling of 
	enthusiasm you get from someone or something, that gives you new and 
	creative ideas."</cite><p><cite>"If you describe someone 
	or something good as an inspiration, you mean that they make you or other 
	people want to do or achieve something."</cite><p><cite>
	"If something or someone is the inspiration for a particular book, work of 
	art, or action, they are the source of the ideas in it or act as a model for 
	it."</cite><p><cite>"If you suddenly have an 
	inspiration, you suddenly think of an idea of what to do or say."</cite><p>&nbsp;<p>The beautiful thing about 
	inspiration is ordinary people can do some pretty extraordinary things and 
	in the process, they can become inspirational to others.&nbsp; You don't 
	have to be famous or wealthy to be inspirational.&nbsp; I believe everyone 
	can be inspirational and we can be inspired by others.&nbsp; <br>
	<p>I find inspiration in nature, in colleagues, in ordinary and 
	in extraordinary people.&nbsp; I've shared a few links to artists who I find 
	inspirational or thought provoking.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy their work or their work gives you 
	pause to think and consider possibilities.
